# Description of contents of this folder

- `layers_sensitivity_training_plot/`: contains code for plotting the training plots shown in the layers sensitivity study in the Medium blog
- `freebase_entity_mapping`: this folder contains pre-processing (a bit of a misnomer for the title of this folder). In summary, nodes in the CWQ dataset subgraphs are taken from the much larger Freebase knowledge graph. Each node/entity is represented in four different ways in the course of the GNN/LLM modeling: a global integer ID, local integer ID (which exists transiently within a batch), machine ID (an alphanumeric string), and corresponding text. The original GNN-RAG authors provided a .json file which mapped entity machine IDs to text. They also provided a text file which mapped global IDs to machine IDs. However, there were many entities missing from the .json file which were present in the text file. To aid in our interpretation and analysis, we undertook an extraction of additional entity IDs from the Freebase raw dataset. Some of the scripts pertaining to this work are included in this folder.
- `gnn_results_postproc`: contains scripts that postproc the results of GNN experiments from Part II to enable deeper analysis
